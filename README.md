Use Channels DVR as a TV Tuner Source for playback using other clients.   

The concept is simple:  Use the Channels DVR Server as a TV tuner for other applications to use such as Emby, Plex or Perfect Player to watch Live TV.  Channels DVR provides many clients for watching Live TV, but I wanted the capability to watch Live TV using Emby on an old Roku device.  Channels DVR does not support Roku as a client (besides a basic beta version that does not get updates). 

My first attempt resulted in what I consider to be a "basic" method to allow Emby to use the Channels DVR Server as a TV tuner.  I consider this basic because it can be accomplished with little effort.  This method will not work for Plex or Perfect Player. 

For a more useful solution, the "advance" method makes use of xmltv, xTeve and Schedules Direct subscription.  The benefit is that Emby, Plex and Perfect Player can all use Channels DVR as a TV tuner. It should also word with any software teh supports m3u channel lists and xml EPG capabilities.
